# Q&A
+ ``Refresh Package`` vs ``Update Project``
    * ``Refresh Package`` can update the project by the ``package.xml`` in the project folder or ``project/src`` folder
    * ``Update Project`` will update the project according to ``subscribed metadata``

+ ``Refresh Folder`` vs ``Update Project``
    * Generally, ``Refresh Folder`` can be used to update the components in the chosen folders
    * However, ``Update Project`` is always used to refresh all folders or newly subscribed metadata

+ ``Save to Server`` vs ``Deploy to Server``
    * ``Save to Server`` is achieved by ``Tooling API`` tech, which is usually used to develop apex code in sandbox
    * ``Deploy to Server`` is achieved by ``Metadata API`` tech, which is usually used to develop none-apex in sandbox, deploy any components into different org or production

+ What's the usage of ``Update Project Pattern`` command?
    * Everytime when you update the ``file_exclude_patterns`` or ``folder_exclude_patterns``, you must execute ``Update Project Pattern`` command to ensure it is working.
