Update
----------
Currently there are still lots of developers using `haoide` for SFDC development. Since @xjsender has less time on the project, I will continue to maintain this project and [haoide-vscode](https://github.com/xjsender/haoide-vscode)  for the community.  

Thanks @xjsender for the years contributions on the project and Salesforce developing community.
